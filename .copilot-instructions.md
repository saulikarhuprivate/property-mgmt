# Copilot Instructions

## Terminal Commands
- Always assume the environment is VS Code on Windows.
- Prefer PowerShell or Command Prompt compatible commands.
- Avoid Unix-specific commands like `ls`, `grep`, `touch`, `rm` unless using PowerShell aliases or equivalents is safe.
- When suggesting file paths in commands, ensure they are compatible with Windows (e.g., using backslashes `\` or quoting paths if necessary).
